YoutubeWatchParty - Team 9

Watch Youtube videos together. 
Parties (aka groups) are public and only require their ID to join.
Between devices, video playback is synchronized in real time.
When someone changes the video, pauses/unpauses the video, or seeks to
a different time, the action is forwarded to every client in the party.

The project can be launched with `cdk deploy`. All dependency installation
and packing will be done automatically. Once launched, the site URL is:
  http://youtubewatchparty.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
