Scaling for this project is straightforward.
* S3 access automatically scales to meet demand (barring account quotas).
* API Gateway automatically scales to meet demand (barring account quotas).
* Lambda automatically scales to meet demand (barring account quotas).
* DynamoDB as it is configured currently does not scale. To take advantage of
  AWS free tier, DynamoDB is configured as provisioned with 5 read and 5 write
  units. However, it would be a small change to switch DynamoDB to on-demand
  instead of provisioned. If we did this, DynamoDB would scale automatically to
  meet demand. Storage capacity already scales automatically to meet demand.
